# JavaFX Registration and Login Application

This JavaFX application provides a simple registration and login interface. Users can register with a username and password, which are saved to a file, and then log in using their credentials.

Description

This project includes features to:
1. Register with a username and password.
2. Save the user credentials to a file (`users.txt`).
3. Log in using the registered username and password.
4. Display success or error messages based on user actions.

The main class `MainApp` initializes the application, while `RegistrationController` and `LoginController` handle user interactions for the registration and login processes respectively.
